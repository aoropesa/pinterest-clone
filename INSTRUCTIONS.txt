This challenge is to make a pinterest card clone.

See image pinterest clone.png

I have provided you with the CSS, images and starter files. I have also provided you with the data to make 3 cards.
The data reuses the same images which is fine for this exercise. Your challenge is to implement the list of image cards (3).
Please implement propTypes for your components. You are free to make any changes you wish to the CSS or data, but the provided
CSS and data work just fine for this challenge.

HINT: The board consists of nothing more than a list of cards. For the sake of this challenge, do not make it more complex than that.

If you are up for it, implement the header too. Consider reusing the Nav component we built earlier in the class.
This is not required for the quiz, but it provides additional practice if you so want to tackle it. Please don't get too involved
with this as we have a lot of ground to cover today. Complete the challenge to make the 3 cards, and if you don't have enough time
for the header, you can take this home and work on it for your own practice. 

Good Luck!!
